        <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?<br><br>
            Lorem Ipsum is a text used as an example filler in 
            the printing industry. It was first used in the fifteenth 
            century by an unknown printer to fill a sample book with text. 
            Five centuries later, it began to be used in the electronics 
            industry, remaining practically unchanged. It became popular 
            in the 60s with the publication of Letraset sheets containing
             fragments of Lorem Ipsum, and more recently with software
              containing various versions of Lorem Ipsum designed to 
              produce prints on personal computers, such as Aldus
               PageMaker</p>
        <p> What to use it for?<br><br>
            A well-known thesis is that the user can be
             distracted by the understandable content of 
             the page when he wants to see its appearance
              alone. One of the strengths of using Lorem 
              <b>Ipsum is that it has many different</b><br>
              <i> "
              combinations" of sentences, words, </i><br>
              <u> and 
              paragraphs, as opposed to the usual "text, 
              text, text" that makes it look</u><br> 
              <em>
               in English. Many webmasters and designers 
               use Lorem Ipsum as the default text model 
               and typing </em><br> 
               <strong>  into the web search
                engine will find a lot of pages </strong><br>

                 Many versions of
                 the text have evolved and changed over the
                  years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
                  on purpose (humorous inserts, etc.).</p>
