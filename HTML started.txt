# HTML - is not a programming language . It is a way of displaying our codes in website.
It is  a markup language .PHP  or Java are programming languages and use logic and 
conditions in order to do that .

# eg: This is my first very website after restoration and<b>I am very excited.</b> 
   -- I am very excited in the above will be in bold. 
   ==<b> is opening tag
   ==</b>is closing tag
# <!DOCTYPE html>
  - we use it at the top and tells us that it is html file./ declare it is html file

# <html>   
 
  </html>
-- the above tells us that any thing we put inside can inherit the properties of html.

# <body>
    
  </body>
-- it is the main part of html which includes the main files to be written.
#  <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
   </head>

 -- In head we have meta tag. 
 -- utf-8 is a type of unicode used virtually in all codes in the world.
It is seen as a dictinory translating human language to computer. 

# <meta name="viewpoint" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
-- we put the above meta tag in the head section the same way.
-- It is used in responsive website.(display in all devices like tablets,computers,mobilephones).
--width=device--makes the same width as the device in order to run the code.

# <title> </title>
 -- this is title tag that we put in the head section . It sets the title of the webpage.
# Inside <body> </body> 
 -- Inside body tag we have header tag(headline) h1 to h6.
 -- h1 is highest in priority and used in the title of the page.
# We also use paragraph tag <P> tag inside body to make our content in blocks.
# <br> -- br tag is used to put the next word to be in new line.
# <i> </i>--italic tag makes the word in middle italic.
# <u>  </u> -- underline tag makes it underlined.
# <em>  </em>---emphasise tag . It's default is itallic .
#  <strong>  </strong>---same as bold tag . This is strong tag.
# <hr> ---this is horzontal rule tag. It put horzontal line crossing the entire page.
# Link tag -- it is also called a tag   ---<a>  </a>-- a stands for anchor.
To the link tag we also add an attribute. We add href on it
   <a href=" "> </a>
 -- href stands for hypertext reference.
# url - stands for univeresal resource locator. 
It gives the location of file we want to load.
# Target attribute- helps to load the link tag to be open in new page.
Unless it will be opened at the same page.
  eg: <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"> </a>
# Image has an attribute called source.This tells us the source of an image.
  eg: <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/300x150" border="10">
    -- We can add a border attribute which is 10 pixel (10 px).
# There are two types of lists. These are ol and ul . One is ordered list and 
the other is unordered list.
  eg:  <ul>
          <li> apples</li>
          <li>Oranges</li>
       </ul>
  -- here is <ul> if we make it <ol> it will be ordered as 1,2.
  eg2: 
       <ul>
           <li> apples
               <ol>
                  <li>Red apple</li>
                  <li>Green apple</li
                  <li>Yellow apple</li>
                </ol>
           </li>
           <li>Oranges</li>
           <li>Banana</li>
       </ul>
-- we can also put a list in another list. Here apples has another list created in it.
This is called child list.We say apple has child element(list).The outer element which is apple above
is called parent element.We use indentation in our code to make it clear.
--Putting one html tag in to another is called Nesting. 
# Table tag:
eg: 
       <table border="10" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10">
            <tr> 
                <th>Month</th>
                <th>Rent</th>
                <th>Utilities</th>
                <th>Entertainment</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> August</td>
                <td> 1500$</td>
                <td> 350$</td>
                <td> 120$</td>
         

            </tr>
        </table>
-- We have <tr> - table row and <th> which is table header.
---<td> stands for table data.
---We can add an attribute of 10 px border for the table for the outside.
-- cellpadding control the amount of extra space inside each cell. 
--cellspacing makes gap between each cell . Here above we have 10 pixel gap between each cell.

    eg: <th colspan="2">Utilities</th>
-- We can also use row span the same way as column span. In order to put the rows together.
    eg 2:
   <table border="10" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
            <tr> 
                <th> </th>
                <th>Month</th>
                <th>Rent</th>
                <th colspan="2">Utilities</th>
                <th>Entertainment</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="3">Fall</td>
                <td> June</td>
                <td> 1200$</td>
                <td>350$</td>
                <td> 120$</td>
                <td> 100$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> July</td>
                <td> 1400$</td>
                <td>350$</td>
                <td> 120$</td>
                <td> 100$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> August</td>
                <td> 1800$</td>
                <td>350$</td>
                <td> 120$</td>
                <td> 100$</td>
            </tr>
  </table>

-- colspan makes the next 2 to be in one column . In the above 350 and 120 will be in the same 
column under utilities.
